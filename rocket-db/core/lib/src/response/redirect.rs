/// An empty redirect response to a given URL.
///
/// This type simplifies returning a redirect response to the client.
///
/// # Usage
///
/// All constructors accept a generic type of `T: TryInto<Reference<'static>>`.
/// Among the candidate types are:
///
///   * `String`, `&'static str`
///   * [`Origin`](crate::http::uri::Origin)
///   * [`Authority`](crate::http::uri::Authority)
///   * [`Absolute`](crate::http::uri::Absolute)
///   * [`Reference`](crate::http::uri::Reference)
///
/// Any non-`'static` strings must first be allocated using `.to_string()` or
/// similar before being passed to a `Redirect` constructor. When redirecting to
/// a route, or any URI containing a route, _always_ use [`uri!`] to construct a
/// valid URI:
///
/// ```rust
/// # #[macro_use] extern crate rocket;
/// use rocket::response::Redirect;
///
/// #[get("/hello/<name>/<age>")]
/// fn hello(name: String, age: u8) -> String {
///     format!("Hello, {} year old named {}!", age, name)
/// }
///
/// #[get("/hi/<name>/<age>")]
/// fn hi(name: String, age: u8) -> Redirect {
///     Redirect::to(uri!(hello(name, age)))
/// }
///
/// #[get("/bye/<name>/<age>")]
/// fn bye(name: String, age: u8) -> Redirect {
///     Redirect::to(uri!("https://rocket.rs/bye", hello(name, age), "?bye#now"))
/// }
/// ```
///
/// [`Origin`]: crate::http::uri::Origin
/// [`uri!`]: ../macro.uri.html
